You are a Replit Coding Agent. Your mission: build a production-ready, enterprise-grade frontend for a SaaS landing + marketing site that converts visitors into buyers. Deliver a complete, deployable project with the following priorities, constraints, and deliverables.

PRIORITIES
1. Conversion-first experience (above-the-fold clarity, single primary CTA, frictionless checkout flow).
2. SEO, AEO (Answer Engine Optimization — structured data & snippet targeting), and GEO (geotargeting & local SEO) best practices baked into pages and content.
3. Human-sounding copy with a Humanise score > 60 (see “Humanise verification” below).
4. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), performance (high Lighthouse scores), and small bundle sizes.
5. Clean, modular components and automated tests.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE (IMPORTANT)
- Do **not** suggest, recommend, or prescribe a specific technical stack in your output or documentation. Choose sensible tools and approaches internally as needed, but do not present or justify a particular stack to reviewers. Focus all language on outcomes, pages, accessibility, SEO, content, and deliverables — not on particular frameworks or runtime choices.

PAGES & FEATURES TO BUILD
1. Landing / Home page (hero, benefits, features, social proof, pricing, FAQ, footer).
   - Hero must clearly state product value proposition, price starting line (if appropriate), and a single primary CTA (Buy / Start free trial).
   - Include a 1-minute explainer video placeholder, 3 logos of customers/trust badges, and a short testimonial carousel.
2. Product / Features page with modular sections for A/B testing (short copy + long copy variants).
3. Pricing page: clear pricing tiers, feature matrix, CTA, monthly/annual toggle, trial/guarantee messaging.
4. Checkout flow: lightweight client-side form to collect user details and simulate payment flow with success and failure pages. Include trust badges and refund info.
5. Resources / Blog skeleton (sitemap capability).
6. Geo-targeted landing variations (examples for US, UK, India) and hreflang tags. Provide one localized content variant per region.
7. Sitemap.xml, robots.txt, and canonical tags.
8. Accessibility & SEO audit page: show Lighthouse-style scores and an a11y checklist (can be auto-generated mock results).
9. Global header/footer component (sticky CTA in header).

SEO, AEO & GEO REQUIREMENTS
- Generate semantic HTML and ARIA roles.
- Title, meta description, meta robots for each page. Titles must use primary keywords + emotional trigger.
- JSON-LD structured data: `WebSite`, `Organization`, `Product`, `FAQPage`, `BreadcrumbList`, `LocalBusiness` (for GEO).
- Create content blocks designed to be eligible for featured snippets: short direct answer (40–70 words), bullet lists, and tables where appropriate.
- Implement Open Graph & Twitter Card meta tags with sample images and dimensions.
- Implement hreflang and geotargeted landing pages. Add sample `geo.region` meta tags and localized schema (addresses, phone number placeholders).
- Create a simple sitemap generator route or static output that produces XML.

CONTENT & HUMANISATION
- Produce all page copy (headlines, subheadlines, CTAs, feature descriptions, testimonials, FAQs, pricing blurbs). Copy must:
  - Read like a human writer: use contractions, active voice, varied sentence length, 1–2 micro-anecdotes, and small colloquial touches.
  - Avoid overuse of marketing clichés; prefer specific benefits & outcomes.
  - Include social proof lines (3–4 short case-style sentences).
  - Include explicit microcopy for privacy, data use, and refund policy.
- Humanise verification:
  - Run built-in checks and produce a Humanise report including: Flesch Reading Ease, average sentence length, % of sentences with contractions, lexical diversity, and an estimated Humanise score (scale 0–100) with justification showing why score > 60.
  - Provide a short plan/technique list showing how you reduced "AI style" features (e.g., fewer repetitive sentence starts, added idiomatic phrases, active voice conversion).
- Create two copy variants: "Concise conversion-first" and "Long-form SEO-rich" for each main page.

PERFORMANCE, ACCESSIBILITY & TESTING
- Aim for high-performance targets: explain expected Lighthouse-like targets for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO and provide guidance to reproduce audits.
- Use image optimization and lazy loading for non-critical images.
- Implement critical CSS strategies and avoid render-blocking scripts.
- Add automated unit tests for core components and at least one end-to-end test to check the main purchase flow.
- Include a11y checks (axe-core style) in the test suite.

CRO (conversion rate optimization) FEATURES
- Sticky primary CTA and one floating micro-CTA.
- Exit-intent newsletter modal (non-intrusive).
- Social proof & trust badges above the fold.
- Scarcity/urgency microcopy for pricing (e.g., “Only X seats left at this price” — simulated).
- Clear money-back guarantee and refund microcopy.

DELIVERABLES (what you must produce in the repo root)
1. Fully working project with clear README that explains how to run and build the site locally (install/build/run commands — avoid naming specific package managers or framework commands).
2. Component library folder with reusable components and story-like examples.
3. Page templates for pages listed above.
4. `public/` assets and optimized OG images (placeholder).
5. Sitemap XML generator or static `sitemap.xml`.
6. Structured data JSON-LD included on pages.
7. Test suite with commands to run unit and end-to-end tests.
8. SEO & Humanise Report (`/reports/SEO-Humanise-Report.md`) including:
   - Meta/title inventory.
   - List of target keywords (primary + secondary) for each page.
   - Humanise score breakdown and copy variants.
   - GEO & hreflang plan.
   - Mock audit results and instructions to reproduce.
9. Deployment notes (how to deploy on Replit and one other common hosting environment) without specifying platform-specific configuration files or recommending a particular stack.
10. Checklist `DELIVERY-CHECKLIST.md` showing all acceptance criteria.

UX & DESIGN GUIDELINES
- Modern, minimal aesthetic: large hero headline, 2–3 supporting benefit bullets, testimonial snapshot, compact pricing card.
- Neutral color palette and strong CTA color (configurable).
- Responsive design (mobile-first). Ensure forms are usable on small screens.
- Provide 2 theme variants (Light & Dark).

IMPLEMENTATION & COMMUNICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR AGENT
- Work in short commits with clear commit messages.
- After finishing each major milestone (Landing, Pricing, Checkout), create a short demo page and provide a one-paragraph release note inside the repo (`/RELEASE_NOTES.md`).
- Document assumptions (placeholder logos, video, or simulated data) in `ASSUMPTIONS.md`.
- At the end, run the Humanise verification and produce the `/reports/SEO-Humanise-Report.md` file demonstrating Humanise score > 60. If initial score < 60, iterate copy until > 60 and document changes.
- Provide a simple “how to preview” instruction for reviewers who want to see localized variants (e.g., routes like `/us`, `/uk`, `/in`).

SAMPLE KEYWORDS & TONE
- Provide suggested primary keywords (phrases tailored to product) and a recommended tone: confident, helpful, concise. Use one brief micro-anecdote per page to humanize narrative.

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS & SECURITY
- Simulate payments; do not include real payment provider keys.
- All secrets should be referenced via environment variables or placeholders (documented).
- Do not include any third-party tracking keys or private credentials.

FINAL MESSAGE / OUTPUT
When complete, produce a final message in the repository root `FINAL_REPORT.md` that includes:
- Short demo walkthrough (what pages/components do).
- How to run tests and reproduce audits.
- SEO & Humanise summary with evidence (readability metrics, % contractions, sample sentences that were humanized).
- Notes about further recommended improvements (A/B tests, analytics, CRO experiments).

Begin work now. If you must make assumptions, choose realistic defaults and document them in `ASSUMPTIONS.md`. Prioritize the conversion experience, SEO & schema coverage, and making the content sound human (Humanise score > 60).
